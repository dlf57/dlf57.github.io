I am a computational chemist with expertise in materials and drug discovery. Currently, I develop and apply computational tools to discover and analyze novel materials.

I earned my PhD in Physical Chemistry from the University of Pittsburgh in 2022. Before that, I completed my undergraduate studies in Chemistry at Clarkson University, where I was honored with the 2015 Walsh Fellow award.

Throughout my academic journey, I have been deeply involved in various aspects of chemistry research. During my postdoctoral tenure, I focused on analyzing protein systems to develop a comprehensive structural understanding for improved virtual screening. My graduate studies aimed to enhance the applicability of machine learning in solving chemical problems. Additionally, I worked on refining conformer generation processes to improve the accuracy and efficiency of computational chemistry methodologies.

As an undergraduate researcher, I specialized in synthesizing conjugated drug linkers for cancer research, gaining valuable insights into chemical synthesis and its applications in life sciences.

I have also actively contributed to the academic community. I served as a General Chemistry Teaching Assistant at both the University of Pittsburgh and Clarkson University. Additionally, I mentored students in freshman chemistry laboratories at Clarkson University, fostering a passion for chemistry among budding scientists.

Outside academia, I achieved the rank of Eagle Scout in May 2012, exemplifying my dedication to leadership, teamwork, and personal development.

I am enthusiastic about exploring new challenges and collaborative opportunities in computational chemistry, materials science, and biology.
