I was born in Vermont and still go back to visit my family, especially my younger brother, Colton (featured in the image above). It is always great to go back home to the beautiful scenery and explore the Green Mountains, just brace yourself for winters. 

I received my bachelors in Chemistry from Clarkson University in upstate New York. While surviving the freezing cold winters there, I started doing nanomaterial research and later on switched to organic synthesis research. This is where I give props to my friends in synthesis, if I ever see another column again, it will be too soon. 

Currently, I am a Ph.D. student at the University of Pittsburgh studying Computational/Physical Chemistry. A lot of my work involves applying machine learning to search techniques to find the needle in the haystack. In this case my needle is a molecule with optimal organic dielectric properties and my haystack is chemical space.

I have been enjoying Pittsburgh quite a bit. My wife and I are quite happy with this being our home for the time being. The weather change from upstate NY and Vermont is very nice even if it is only 10 or so degrees warmer. The city is a lot cleaner and nicer than my high school US History textbook had lead me to believe.

I spend a lot of my free time tinkering with my computer from physical components to trying out and modifying software. I also spend a lot of time playing around with Rasbperry Pis, with my most recent project setting up a [Pi-hole](https://pi-hole.net/) and with a [ClusterHAT](https://www.raspberrypi.org/magpi/clusterhat-review-cluster-hat-kit/) being an upcoming project.
