## Current Research/Work
I am currently employed as a Computational Materials Scientist at Prometheus Materials, a concrete startup in Colorado aimed at creating sustainable building materials. 

## Previous Research
My Postdoctoral work was in the [Koes Group](https://bits.csb.pitt.edu/) where my focus was been on analyzing protein systems to establish a comprehensive structural understanding that can be used for virtual screening. The work familiarized me with enhanced sampling molecular dynamics methods as well as various molecular docking methods. 

My PhD work was in the [Hutchison Group](http://hutchison.chem.pitt.edu/) using various computational methods to study conformer energies and search for optimal energy storage material. A lot of my work is with using methods such as machine learning and bayesian optimization to try and improve search techniques such as genetic algorithms.
