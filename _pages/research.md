## Current Research
I currently work in the [Koes Group]()

## Previous Research
My PhD work was in the [Hutchison Group](http://hutchison.chem.pitt.edu/) using various computational methods to study conformer energies and search for optimal energy storage material. A lot of my work is with using methods such as machine learning and bayesian optimization to try and improve search techniques such as genetic algorithms.
