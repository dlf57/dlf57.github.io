After many years in the University of Pittsburgh Chemistry department, I have successfully defended my PhD work. It's absolutely mind-boggling to consider that when I began this program, I had absolutely no prior knowledge of coding. Now, as I reach its conclusion, I can proudly say that I've acquired the skills to code machine learning models proficiently. Moreover, I actively contributed to the group by working on the genetic algorithm code, developing a Python package for molecular representations, and helping work on the development of a conformer sampling method. It's been an incredible journey of growth and learning.
