-----------

chemreps has moved on to the beta stage. We are currently working on [more representations](https://github.com/chemreps/chemreps/projects/1) that will be included in the first official release.    

For now you can install v0.1.0 through pypi with `pip install chemreps` or you can head over to [GitHub](https://github.com/chemreps/chemreps) to grab the latest development version.

Please feel free to visit our [Gitter community](https://gitter.im/chemreps/community) to ask us any questions!
