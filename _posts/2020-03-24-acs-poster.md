The Spring 2020 ACS National Meeting was canceled due to COVID-19 and the poster session was moved to online. The poster can be found [here](https://www.morressier.com/article/assessing-conformer-energies-machine-learning-vs-conventional-quantum-chemistry/5e735fdfcde2b641284a9d99), but I am also uploading my poster here in case the site is not accessible once the online conference is over.
