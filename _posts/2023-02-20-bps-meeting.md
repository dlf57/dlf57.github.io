The Biophysical Society meeting ended up being my first in-person conference as COVID had gotten in the way of attending others during the last few years of graduate school. Not only was this an interesting conference but it also took place in San Diego, California, a place I had been wanting to visit. My presentation for this conference was a poster on the conformational changes of glycine receptors. During the poster session, I was able to chat with one of the authors of the Cryo-EM paper on the alpha1 receptor. They seemed pleased to see that we had computationally verified the ligand binding site. Overall, it was a great trip and I really enjoyed myself (even with the early travel issues).
