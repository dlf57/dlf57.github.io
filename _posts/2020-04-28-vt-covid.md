This is a quick look at how COVID-19 is impacting the state of Vermont. All data is from [Johns Hopkins University](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19) and is processed by [datasets/covid-19](https://github.com/datasets/covid-19). None of the data is my work (but is freely available through the linked sources). My contribution is the Vermont specific figures from this data. The figures are interactive so scrolling your mouse over or clicking on mobile will provide additional information. The notebook used to generate these plots can be found [here](../../assets/ipynb/VT-analysis.ipynb).
