The entire Koes group went to ACS in Indianapolis. I had volunteered to present my poster at Sci-Mix but was also scheduled to do both an oral and poster presentation. My oral presentation was on the assessment of torsional preferences for conformer sampling in the Quantum section. While it had been a while since I had presented my graduate work, it was nice to discuss conformer generation methods again. My poster was in the COMP poster session where I was presenting an updated version of my poster from BPS on evaluating conformational changes of glycine receptors. Unfortunately, I did not have time to update all that much due to the short amount of time between conferences. Overall it was a good conference with a lot of talks on the advancements being done in molecular machine learning.
